Stack: FastAPI (backend) + React/Vite (frontend) + Recharts (charts) + yfinance (data)
Status: MVP working. Stable endpoints. Conservative signals. Good enough to iterate.

What v1 does

Prices + indicators
OHLCV with SMA/EMA/RSI, volume change, price/MA ratios. Caching + multiple data sources. If a provider hiccups, it returns last good data marked as stale: true.

Signals (baseline + RF v1)
Next-day direction probability + tiny return estimate. Falls back to an honest EMA baseline if the model isn’t available or data is weird. Treat as research/paper trading only. All practice, not to be treated as financial advice.

News + sentiment
Curated RSS feeds, VADER sentiment, relevance boosted by ticker mentions. Filters by ticker, source, and min sentiment.

Observability
/api/health and /api/metrics to check model and data status.

Quickstart

I run backend + frontend in two terminals. Windows commands shown (adjust for macOS/Linux).

1) Backend (FastAPI)

cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# optional: copy .env.example to .env (see below)
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
# API: http://127.0.0.1:8000
# Docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

2) Frontend (React + Vite)

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# App: http://localhost:5173


API cheat-sheet

GET /api/health → service + provider status
GET /api/metrics → model metadata (name, last_trained_at, samples_used, etc.)
GET /api/price?ticker=AAPL&range=6mo&interval=1d → OHLCV + indicators + {stale, source}
GET /api/predict?ticker=AAPL → conservative next-day signal (RF v1 or EMA baseline)
GET /api/news?ticker=AAPL&limit=30&min_sentiment=-0.2&source=Reuters → curated news
Errors are structured. Common ones:
{"code":"no_data"} → bad/unknown ticker (returns 404)
{"code":"upstream_failed"} → data providers down (returns 502)

3) Training Model

cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate
python train_models.py --tickers SPY,AAPL,MSFT,NVDA,AVGO,META,GOOGL,AMZN,TSLA --period 5y
# This writes models/*.joblib (gitignored).
# Restart the API after training:
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

Troubleshooting

White screen / Vite error about styles.css
Make sure frontend/src/styles.css exists and is imported in src/main.jsx.

“No price data for this ticker” (404)
Ticker typo or delisted (e.g., MFST vs MSFT). Try a different symbol.

“Upstream price provider failed” (502)
Data providers are flaky sometimes. Try again; baseline will still work for already-cached names.

Prediction always says “baseline”
You didn’t train RF v1, or the API can’t find models. Train with the command above and restart the backend.

Scikit-learn warnings about feature names
We pass numpy arrays at predict-time now, so warnings should be gone. If you see any, they’re harmless.

All zeros / flat lines
Usually means Yahoo returned empty/invalid rows. The backend now rejects “all-zero” payloads and tries fallbacks; refresh or change the ticker.
